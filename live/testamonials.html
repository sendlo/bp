                                    <p class="prev-indent-bot">I came to know Mia through another pet sitter that I have been using as a referral.  She came highly recommended, so I decided to meet her and see how she fit with my two dogs.  My dogs love her and are so thrilled when they see her.  She is a natural with my pets! We all love Mia!</p>

                                    <p class="prev-indent-bot">I have Mia come in to my home to feed and take care of my cat Malee. She spends extra time to make sure she is content and happy. She sends me a photo of Malee when I am away and it is comforting to see that my cat is doing well. I cannot recommend her more highly!</p>

 <!--                                   <span class="text-2 p1">Benicia, CA</span> -->
                                    <p class="prev-indent-bot">Bogie was traumatized many years ago at a veterinary office.  His toe nails were cut beyond the quick.  We quickly changed veterinary offices and discovered Mia.  She was a vet tech and immediately "read" Bogie and could quickly see what he would and could tolerate.  No one else as best they tried could get him past his trauma.  He would turn purple and need oxygen just having "anyone" touch his toes.  Mia, had never met him before and was assigned his "toe nail trim" that day.  He just KNEW she was safe and that she could be trusted.  He allowed her to trim all of his toe  nails without drugs or oxygen.  The entire staff thought that that pug could not possibly be Bogie.  Mia brought him out to me, his head held high, his tail curled up on his back (sign of a happy pug) and a kick in his step.  Because of this instant relationship with her and his heartfelt trust in her we have kept up this relationship since then.  I now meet her in a parking lot once every six weeks to 8 weeks where we sit in her car as Mia gives Bogie  his "mani-pedi".  This last time he feel asleep in her lap as she worked on his toes.  Could there be a better relationship of trust?  I think not.  I know "not".  We thank you Mia for your constant care and that something that cannot be described in words.  You have a natural gift that animals know can be trusted.  A kindness beyond words.</p>
